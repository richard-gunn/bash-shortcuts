# INTRODUCTION ###

BASH Shortcuts is a shell command that allows you to bookmark your
favourite/often-visited directories. It's only really useful if you spend a
significant time using the shell.

Shortcuts can be created, updated, deleted, listed and exported as BASH
environment variables.


# INSTALLATION ###

Copy or move the entire .bash-shortcuts directory to your home directory.

Edit the existing file ~/.bashrc and add the following lines of code (copy and
paste the code shown inside the dashed lines - do not include the dashed lines):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# BASH Shortcuts - BEGIN #
if [ -f ~/.bash-shortcuts/sc.sh ]; then
  . ~/.bash-shortcuts/sc.sh
fi
# BASH Shortcuts - END #

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open a new shell window to test the installation:

  - Any errors will be reported as soon as the shell window opens
  - Type 'sc -h' to determine whether the 'sc' command is active


# OVERVIEW ###

The shortcut commands can be expressed in three distinct forms:

  1 - sc + <short-option> + parameter(s)
    e.g. sc -d SHORTCUT

  2 - sc + <long-option> + parameter(s)
    e.g. sc --delete SHORTCUT

  3 - <command-alias> + parameter(s)
    e.g. scdelete SHORTCUT


# SHORTCUTS AND LABELS ###

Shortcuts are aliases for directory paths.

Shortcuts can be defined with or without a label.

IMPORTANT: Shortcut names can only contain lower-case letters, digits and
hyphen characters. Spaces, underscores and other punctuation characters are not
allowed - this is to ensure uniqueness when exporting to BASH variables.

A label can to be added to a shortcut to replace the full path with a more
meaningful description when the shortcuts are listed.

If a shortcut is defined without a label, then it will be listed along with the
full path to the directory that it points to.


# GETTING COMMAND HELP ###

HELP-COMMAND = sc -h | sc --help | schelp

Format: HELP-COMMAND

To get command help, type:

> schelp


# ADDING NEW SHORTCUTS ###

ADD-COMMAND = sc -a | sc --add | scadd

Format: ADD-COMMAND <shortcut-name> [<target-path>] ['<label-text>']

NOTE: The label text has to be enclosed in single quotes.


Example 1:

To create a new shortcut with a default name for the current directory:

> scadd


Example 2:

To create a new shortcut with a name of 'music-files' for the current directory:

> scadd 'music-files'

or

> scadd 'music-files' .


Example 3:

To create a new shortcut with a name of 'music-files' and a label for the
current directory:

> scadd 'music-files' . 'My Favourite Music'


Example 4:

To create a new shortcut named 'music-files', with a directory path of
'/mnt/external-drive/music-files' and a label:

> scadd music-files /mnt/external-drive/music-files 'My Favourite Music'


# LISTING SHORTCUTS ###

Use command 'sc' with no parameters to list all defined shortcuts:

> sc

Note: There are no alternative commands to list shortcuts


# USING A SHORTCUT ###

Use command 'sc' with a shortcut name to go to the directory.

Format: sc <shortcut-name>

Example: To 'cd' to a shortcut named 'test-logs':

> sc test-logs


# UPDATING SHORTCUTS ###

UPDATE-COMMAND = sc -u | sc --update | scupdate

Same syntax as 'scadd' except the shortcut name already exists.


# DELETING SHORTCUTS ###

DELETE-COMMAND = sc -d | sc --delete | scdelete

Format: DELETE-COMMAND <shortcut-name>

Example: To delete a shortcut named 'test-logs', simply type:

> scdelete test-logs


# GET SHORTCUT DIRECTORY PATH ###

GET-COMMAND = sc -g | sc --get | scget

Format: GET-COMMAND <shortcut-name>

Example: To get the directory path for shortcut named 'test-logs':

> scget test-logs


# EXPORTING SHORTCUTS ###

EXPORT-COMMAND = sc -e | sc --export | scexport

Format: EXPORT-COMMAND

Example: To export all shortcuts to BASH variables:

> scexport

Note: Shortcut names will be converted to uppercase and prefixed with 'SHCUT_'


# THEMES ###

BASH Shortcuts is supplied with a 'light' and 'dark' theme. This sets the text
colours for the shortcut names and label text in the shortcut listing.

THEME-COMMAND = sc -t | sc --theme | sctheme

Format: THEME-COMMAND <theme-name>

Example: Use the 'light' theme

> sctheme light


# USING SHORTCUTS WITH OTHER SHELL COMMANDS ###

Use the 'scget' command to retrieve the directory path for a shortcut.

Example: List the contents of a shortcut named 'test-logs'

> ls $( scget test-logs )


# GNU/LINUX DISTRO COMPATIBILITY ###

BASH Shortcuts was developed using Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx). Ubuntu is a
GNU/Linux distro based on Debian. BASH Shortcuts should run fine on other
Debian-based distros such as Mint.

BASH Shortcuts has been tested on the following distributions:

  Ubuntu 10.04
  Fedora 14
  openSuse 11.2


# REPORTING BUGS ###

If you find a bug, then please consider raising a bug report so the developer
can improve the quality of future releases.

Bug tracking and posting can be accessed through the following link:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/bash-shortcuts/support

A test suite is included with BASH Shortcuts - running the test suite may help
identify the root cause of any bugs you may encounter.

Run the test suite script (./sc-test-suite.sh) and attach the latest log files
(found in ./tests/logs) to a new bug report.
